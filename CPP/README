INFO-RNA uses the libRNA.a from the Vienna RNA Package. Thus before compiling
INFO-RNA, you have to configure and install the Vienna RNA Package. You can
download it at: 

http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/

Then modidy the Makefile of INFO-RNA such that the library path is set 
correctly, e.g.:

VIENNA          = /home/Vienna_1.6



INFO-RNA 2.0 can handle sequence constraints, which can be given in IUPAC
symbols using the -c option. Using an additional binary vector, you can allow
some of the constraints to be violated.

Furthermore, INFO-RNA 2.1 can be initialized with a random sequence fulfilling
all constraints.

INFO-RNA 2.1.1 adapts to the new g++ compiler.

INFO-RNA 2.1.2 corrects a minor error occurring for hairpin loops of size >30bp.
